#  Cardinals and Cubs Battle it Out in the NL Central

The race for the National League Central crown is shaping up to be one of the most exciting in baseball. Two teams at the top of their game, the Cardinals and Cubs, are battling it out for control of the division.

The Cardinals got off to a hot start, but the Cubs have been closing the gap in recent weeks. The two teams will meet head-to-head over a crucial 10-game stretch starting on September 9.

The Cardinals currently lead the division by 1.5 games, but they know that they can’t take anything for granted. “We know that they’re a great team and they’re going to give us everything we can handle,” said Cardinals outfielder Dexter Fowler.

Cardinals pitcher Carlos Martinez agrees with Fowler’s assessment. “It’s not going to be easy,” he said. “We have to go out there and play our best ball if we want to stay ahead of them.”

The Cubs are led by MVP candidate Kris Bryant and NL Cy Young frontrunner Kyle Hendricks. They also have a deep lineup which has been stepping up in key moments this season.

Both teams are playing well right now and it should be an exciting battle down the stretch.

#  Dodgers Get Hot in August, Take NL West Lead

The Los Angeles Dodgers got hot in August, and now they hold the lead in the NL West.

In early August, the Dodgers were struggling. They had lost seven of their last 10 games, and their record sat at 58-57. They were in third place in the NL West, behind the Colorado Rockies and the Arizona Diamondbacks.

However, the Dodgers turned things around in August. They won eight of their first 10 games in the month, and they now sit atop the NL West with a record of 66-57. The Rockies are in second place at 64-59, while the Diamondbacks are in third place at 63-60.

What has led to the Dodgers’ turnaround? One big reason is their offense. In early August, they were averaging just 4.3 runs per game. However, over their last 10 games, they have averaged 6.5 runs per game. Some of this can be attributed to players like Justin Turner and Yasiel Puig getting hot at the plate. Turner is hitting .433 over his last 10 games, while Puig is hitting .370 over that span.

Another key for the Dodgers has been their pitching staff. In early August, their team ERA was 4.06. However, over their last 10 games it has dropped to 3.27. This has been led by ace pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who is 5-0 with a 0.59 ERA over his last six starts.

The Dodgers will look to continue their hot streak as they head into September and try to win their first NL West title since 2009.

#  Red Sox Clinch AL East Division Crown

The Boston Red Sox have clinched their first AL East Division Crown in five years, and they did it in impressive fashion. The Sox entered their final three games of the season against the Toronto Blue Jays needing just one win to clinch the division, and they got it in dramatic fashion.

Boston’s offense was clicking all weekend, scoring a total of 24 runs over the three-game series. J.D. Martinez led the way, going 7 for 12 with two home runs and six RBIs. Mookie Betts, Andrew Benintendi, Rafael Devers, and Xander Bogaerts also contributed offensively, helping the Sox earn wins on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Meanwhile, the Red Sox’s pitching staff was solid as well. David Price pitched six innings on Friday night and allowed just one run on four hits. Drew Pomeranz followed that up on Saturday with seven innings of one-run ball, and Chris Sale closed out the series on Sunday by striking out 11 batters in seven innings of work.

With the AL East Division Crown now in hand, the Red Sox can turn their attention to bigger goals. They currently sit atop the American League standings with a 97-64 record and will begin postseason play next week as one of the favorites to win the World Series.

#  Astros Claw Their Way to Second Place in AL West

The Astros have been playing well as of late, and with their win against the Yankees yesterday they have now officially moved up to second place in the AL West.

Houston has needed this strong play in order to stay afloat as they continue to battle some key injuries. Carlos Correa and George Springer, both All-Stars this season, have missed significant time recently with Springer only just returning to the lineup a few days ago. Despite these setbacks, the Astros remain just one game behind the division-leading Oakland Athletics.

One of the biggest reasons for Houston's recent success has been their pitching. Justin Verlander has been his usual dominant self while Gerrit Cole has also had a great season. The bullpen has also been excellent, led by Roberto Osuna who was acquired in a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays earlier this year.

Houston will look to keep things going as they head into a crucial series against the A's this week. With both teams trying to pull ahead in the standings, these matchups should be very exciting to watch.

#  Yankees Stay Alive in Race for Wildcard Spot

The Bronx Bombers entered Wednesday’s game against the Kansas City Royals four games behind the Oakland Athletics for the second American League Wildcard spot. But thanks to a strong performance by pitcher Luis Severino and a late-game home run by Didi Gregorius, the Yankees pulled off an 8-4 victory to stay alive in the playoff race.

Severino was dominant for most of the game, allowing just two runs over seven innings while striking out six batters. In the top of the eighth inning, however, he began to struggle, giving up a pair of singles and a walk that loaded the bases with no outs. Manager Aaron Boone opted to bring in reliever Dellin Betances to try and get out of the jam. And Betances did just that, striking out three consecutive batters to keep the Yankees in front.

The Yankees then tacked on four more runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, thanks in part to Gregorius’s solo home run. The shortstop has been red hot lately, batting .471 with six homers and 16 RBI over his last 10 games.

With Wednesday’s victory, the Yankees pulled within three games of the A’s for the second AL Wildcard spot. They still have a tough road ahead if they hope to make it to October baseball, but their playoff hopes are still alive.
