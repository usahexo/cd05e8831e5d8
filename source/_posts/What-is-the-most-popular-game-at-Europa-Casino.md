#  What are the wagering requirements for casino bonuses?

A casino bonus is an incentive that online casinos offer to their players. These bonuses can be in the form of free money, free spins or a matching deposit bonus. In order to receive the bonus, you will likely be required to meet the wagering requirements.

The wagering requirement is a set number of times that you must play through the bonus amount before you can withdraw any winnings. This is to prevent players from accepting a bonus and then cashing out immediately. The wagering requirement will vary depending on the casino and the bonus offered.

Most casinos require that you wager between 20 and 50 times the bonus amount. So, if you received a $100 bonus with a 20x wagering requirement, you would need to play through $2000 worth of bets before being able to withdraw any winnings.

Some casinos also have a maximum withdrawal amount for bonuses. So, even if you meet the wagering requirement, you may still not be able to withdraw all of your winnings. Make sure to read the terms and conditions of any casino bonus before accepting it.
