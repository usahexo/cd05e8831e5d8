#  What is the Book of Gates? 

The Book of Gates is an ancient Egyptian funerary text dating to the New Kingdom. It consists of a series of gates, each leading to one of the six realms of the afterlife. The text may have been composed by illuminated scribes, who were responsible for the creation of many works of art in tombs and temples.

The book begins with an invocation to Osiris, Lord of the Dead, asking him to permit the deceased to pass through the gates. The first gate is that of Duat, guarded by a serpent named Ammit. The next gate leads to the realm of Osiris, where the deceased will be judged according to their deeds in life. Beyond this lies the realm of the gods, home to Horus and Ra. The fourth gate is that of Nekhen, ruled by the vulture goddess Nekhbet. The fifth gate leads to Aaru, realm of the goddesses Isis and Nephthys. Finally, the sixth and last gate leads to the underworld ruled by Osiris.
