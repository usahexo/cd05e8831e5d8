2. It leads to more maintainable code because you are no longer mixing presentation and logic together. This makes it easier to update your styling without affecting your codebase.

3. You can use JavaScript expressions in your css which gives you more flexibility when styling your components. For example, you could use Math.random() to generate a random color every time a component is rendered.
