        <h1 id="Can-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-Kick-Off-the-Season-with-a-Win-Against-Hamburger-SV"><a href="#Can-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-Kick-Off-the-Season-with-a-Win-Against-Hamburger-SV" class="headerlink" title="Can Bayer 04 Leverkusen Kick Off the Season with a Win Against Hamburger SV?"></a>Can Bayer 04 Leverkusen Kick Off the Season with a Win Against Hamburger SV?</h1><p>With the new Bundesliga season set to start on Friday, August 18 with a clash between Bayer 04 Leverkusen and Hamburger SV, both sides will be eager to get off to a good start. While Bayer are coming into the new season with some fresh additions, HSV find themselves in a state of flux with a new coach and plenty of players leaving in the summer.</p>
<p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen come into this game on the back of a decent preseason. They have won four out of their six games, drawing the other two. Their recent results include wins against Villarreal and Lazio, as well as a draw against Sporting CP. New signings Lucas Alario and Mitchell Weiser have both looked promising in preseason and will be keen to carry that form into the Bundesliga season.</p>
<p>Hamburger SV, meanwhile, have had a much more tumultuous preseason. They have only won one game, drawing four and losing one. Their only win came against lower-league side TuS Haltern am See. In terms of results against higher-quality opposition, they were soundly beaten by both Hertha Berlin and RB Leipzig. Striker Bobby Wood has left for Premier League side West Ham United, while Aaron Hunt has also departed the club. Nicolai Muller is currently out injured.</p>
<p>This looks like it could be a difficult game for Hamburger SV. They are missing key players through injury or departure and are up against a Bayer side who have been in good form in preseason. Bayer should be able to win this game comfortably and start their Bundesliga campaign with three points.</p>
<h1 id="How-Will-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-Fare-in-Their-First-Bundesliga-Match-of-the-Season"><a href="#How-Will-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-Fare-in-Their-First-Bundesliga-Match-of-the-Season" class="headerlink" title="How Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fare in Their First Bundesliga Match of the Season?"></a>How Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fare in Their First Bundesliga Match of the Season?</h1><p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen had a very strong preseason. They played in six friendlies and won four, drew one, and lost one. One of their most impressive victories came against Valencia CF on penalties. Bayer 04 Leverkusen has also been very busy in the transfer market. They have acquired some top talent, such as defender Lukas Heichstadt and goalkeeper Lars Bender.</p>
<p>The question on everyone’s mind is how will all of these new players gel together and fare in their first Bundesliga match of the season? The match is away to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. Hoffenheim had a decent preseason as well, winning three matches, drawing two, and losing one. However, they have not been as active in the transfer market as Bayer 04 Leverkusen and have lost some key players, such as Sandro Wagner and Nadiem Amiri.</p>
<p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen is definitely the favorite in this match. They are coming off of a strong preseason and have significantly more talent than Hoffenheim. However, it will not be easy for them to win on the road against a team that is motivated to beat them. I predict that Bayer 04 Leverkusen will win 2-0 with goals from Kai Havertz and Julian Brandt.</p>
<h1 id="Which-Players-Will-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-Start-Against-Hamburger-SV"><a href="#Which-Players-Will-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-Start-Against-Hamburger-SV" class="headerlink" title="Which Players Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen Start Against Hamburger SV?"></a>Which Players Will Bayer 04 Leverkusen Start Against Hamburger SV?</h1><p>,</p>
<p>​Bayer 04 Leverkusen will be looking to get back to winning ways in the Bundesliga when they take on Hamburger SV on Saturday. The Werkself suffered a shock 2-1 defeat away at 2. Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the DFB-Pokal in their last outing, and manager Roger Schmidt will be keen to see a reaction from his players this weekend.</p>
<p>​Schmidt is set to name an unchanged team from the one that lost at Kaiserslautern, with Bernd Leno set to continue in goal, Tin Jedvaj and Wendell at fullback and Kyriakos Papadopoulos, Jonathan Tah and Ömer Toprak partners in the heart of defense. In midfield, there will be a battle for places between Charles Aránguiz, Lars Bender, Julian Brandt, Vladlen Yurchenko and Christoph Kramer, while Admir Mehmedi and Stefan Kießling are likely to start up front.</p>
<p>​Hamburger SV come into this game having lost their last two matches in the Bundesliga. The first was a 3-0 home defeat against Borussia Mönchengladbach, before they went down 2-1 away at VfB Stuttgart last time out. Manager Bruno Labbadia is likely to make changes to his team for this game, with Albin Ekdal likely to start alongside Gideon Jung in central midfield, while Nicolai Müller could come into the team on the right wing in place of Bobby Wood. Up front, Michael Gregoritsch looks set to start as the lone striker.</p>
<h1 id="bundesliga-2017-2018-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-face-tough-test-against-Hamburg"><a href="#bundesliga-2017-2018-Bayer-04-Leverkusen-face-tough-test-against-Hamburg" class="headerlink" title="bundesliga 2017-2018: Bayer 04 Leverkusen face tough test against Hamburg"></a>bundesliga 2017-2018: Bayer 04 Leverkusen face tough test against Hamburg</h1><p>The 2017-2018 Bundesliga season is shaping up to be a very interesting one, with plenty of teams vying for the title. One of those teams is Bayer 04 Leverkusen, who face a tough test against Hamburg on Saturday.</p>
<p>Leverkusen come into this match in good form, having won their last two fixtures. They will be looking to continue that run and pick up all three points against Hamburg. However, Hamburg are also in good form, having won their last two games as well. This should be a thriller of a game and could go either way.</p>
<p>Leverkusen are led by star striker Javier Hernandez, who has been in excellent form this season. He will be looking to score against Hamburg and add to his tally of six goals so far this season. Hernandez will be supported by midfielders Julian Brandt and Kai Havertz, who have both been in superb form lately.</p>
<p>Hamburg are led by talismanic striker Bobby Wood, who has scored five goals already this season. He will be looking to add to that tally against Leverkusen and help his team get a win. Wood will be supported by midfielder Filip Kostic, who has also been in great form lately.</p>
<p>This should be a very close game with both teams fighting hard for the three points. In the end, I predict that Leverkusen will narrowly edge out Hamburg and win the match 2-1.</p>
<h1 id="Bayer-04-Leverkusen-take-on-HSV-in-the-Bundesliga-opener"><a href="#Bayer-04-Leverkusen-take-on-HSV-in-the-Bundesliga-opener" class="headerlink" title="Bayer 04 Leverkusen take on HSV in the Bundesliga opener"></a>Bayer 04 Leverkusen take on HSV in the Bundesliga opener</h1><p>The Bundesliga season is set to get underway on Friday evening, with last season’s runners-up Bayer 04 Leverkusen hosting Hamburger SV.</p>
<p>Die Werkself have made several notable additions in the offseason, most notably bringing in striker Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernandez from Manchester United. They will be looking to build on their excellent campaign last year, which saw them finish second behind Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Hamburg, meanwhile, narrowly avoided relegation last season and will be looking to improve under new coach Bruno Labbadia. They have made a few signings of their own this summer, but are still likely to be one of the weaker sides in the division.</p>
<p>Leverkusen should have too much for Hamburg and should win comfortably at the BayArena.</p>
