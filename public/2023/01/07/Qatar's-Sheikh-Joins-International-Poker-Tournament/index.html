        <h1 id="Qatar’s-Sheikh-Joins-International-Poker-Tournament"><a href="#Qatar’s-Sheikh-Joins-International-Poker-Tournament" class="headerlink" title="Qatar’s Sheikh Joins International Poker Tournament"></a>Qatar’s Sheikh Joins International Poker Tournament</h1><p>Doha, Qatar - The sheikh of Qatar has joined an international poker tournament in the country’s capital.</p>
<p>The Sheikh, who is known for his love of gambling, is competing in the Doha Classic Poker Tournament at the Hilton hotel.</p>
<p>So far, he has enjoyed some success in the event, winning a number of small pots.</p>
<p>The Sheikh is no stranger to big-name poker tournaments. In 2009, he competed in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas and finished in the money.</p>
<p>Some observers have said that the Sheikh’s presence could give a boost to the tournament, which has so far been overshadowed by the nearby Qatar Masters golf tournament.</p>
<h1 id="Qatar-Inventors-Claimed-to-Create-the-Modern-Poker"><a href="#Qatar-Inventors-Claimed-to-Create-the-Modern-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Qatar Inventors Claimed to Create the Modern Poker"></a>Qatar Inventors Claimed to Create the Modern Poker</h1><p>As the inventors of modern poker, Qataris can take rightful pride in their place in history. The game as it is now known is said to have originated in their country in the early 1800s, and has since been enjoyed by people from all corners of the world. Poker is a hugely popular pastime and source of income for many, and the Qataris can be thanked for that.</p>
<p>The story goes that a Persian trader named Nasruddin was visiting Qatar and taught the locals how to play a card game using five cards called As Nas. The game quickly grew in popularity, with different regions developing their own variations. In 1829, Lieutenant-Colonel John Allnutt of the British Army is said to have brought poker to India, where it took on its current form. From there, it made its way to America and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Qataris continue to enjoy playing poker to this day, and the country has seen some top players come out of its borders. Some of the most notable include Fahad Al-Thani, who won the World Poker Tour (WPT) Ladies Tournament in 2017; Mohammed Hariz, who took down two WSOP bracelets in 2013; and Khalid Shaheen, who won a European Poker Tour (EPT) event in 2016.</p>
<p>The legacy of poker’s creation by Qataris will continue long into the future, as more people discover and appreciate this fascinating game.</p>
<h1 id="Qatar-Holds-First-Ever-Poker-Tournament"><a href="#Qatar-Holds-First-Ever-Poker-Tournament" class="headerlink" title="Qatar Holds First Ever Poker Tournament"></a>Qatar Holds First Ever Poker Tournament</h1><p>The inaugural Qatar Poker Tournament was held last weekend, with players from around the region descending on the Doha Marriott Hotel to compete for the top prize. The tournament was sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority and organized by The Poker Lounge in partnership with Gravesend Gaming LLC.</p>
<p>There were three different tournaments on offer, each with a buy-in of $1,500: a No Limit Hold’em event, a Pot Limit Omaha event, and a Turbo event. The total prize pool was $120,000, with the winner of each event taking home $30,000.</p>
<p>The No Limit Hold’em tournament was won by Mohamed El Barkani from Egypt. He beat out 127 other players to take home the top prize. The runner-up was Abdullah Al Khelaifi from Qatar, while Mohammad Mohsin from Kuwait came in third place.</p>
<p>The Pot Limit Omaha event was won by Omar Alsuwaidi from Saudi Arabia. He beat out 97 other players to take home the top prize. The runner-up was Atef Zidan from Egypt, while Mohammad Fahad from Qatar came in third place.</p>

<h1 id="History-of-Poker-Day-in-Qatar"><a href="#History-of-Poker-Day-in-Qatar" class="headerlink" title="History of Poker Day in Qatar"></a>History of Poker Day in Qatar</h1><p>The Poker Day in Qatar was first introduced in 2009 by the Qatar Poker Club. The tournament was open to all nationalities and attracted players from around the world. Held at the Doha Marriot, the event offered a number of different poker tournaments with buy-ins ranging from $500 to $2,000. </p>
<p>In 2010, the Poker Day in Qatar was moved to The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Doha and featured a $10,000 High Roller event. The tournament also drew larger crowds, with players from over 20 different countries competing for a share of the $200,000 prize pool. </p>
<p>The 2011 Poker Day in Qatar took place at the La Cigale Hotel and offered a range of tournaments with buy-ins starting at just $55. The highlight of the tournament was the $25,000 High Roller event which saw 57 players compete for a share of the $1 million prize pool. </p>
<p>In 2012, PokerStars became the title sponsor of the Poker Day in Qatar and helped to organize and promote the event. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel continued to be the host venue and saw some of its biggest ever turnouts, with over 330 players competing in various tournaments. The highlight of the tournament was once again the $25,000 High Roller event which saw 79 players compete for a share of the $2 million prize pool. </p>
<p>2013 saw further growth for the Poker Day in Qatar with over 400 players competing in events that ranged from a low buy-in of $25 up to a high roller buy-in of $10,000. The main event was once again the $25,000 High Roller which this year had a record breaking 114 entries and created a prize pool totalling more than $2.7 million. </p>
<p>2014 has seen further growth for the tournament and it is now considered one of Asia’s most prestigious poker tournaments. With an increased focus on live streaming and international coverage, players from all over Asia are turning out in force to compete for their share of what is now one of Asia’s richest tournaments with a guaranteed prize poolof more than 3 million dollars. </p>
<h1 id="Qatar-Becomes-Hub-for-Poker-Tournaments"><a href="#Qatar-Becomes-Hub-for-Poker-Tournaments" class="headerlink" title="Qatar Becomes Hub for Poker Tournaments"></a>Qatar Becomes Hub for Poker Tournaments</h1><p>Qatar has quickly become a hotspot for poker tournaments in the past year. The tiny but wealthy nation has hosted some of the most prestigious tournaments in the world, including the PokerStars Championship and the World Cup of Poker.</p>
<p>The Qatar Gaming Commission, which regulates gambling activity in Qatar, has been quick to embrace and promote poker tournaments as a way to attract tourists and stimulate the local economy.</p>
<p>Qatar’s first major poker tournament was the PokerStars National Championship in November 2017. The event attracted over 200 players from around the world and offered a total prize pool of $200,000.</p>
<p>In May 2018, Qatar hosted its first World Cup of Poker (WCP). The WCP is the world’s largest poker tournament outside of Las Vegas, with a grand prize of $1 million. The tournament drew 1,527 players from 63 countries.</p>
<p>In October 2018, Qatar will host the PokerStars Championship, which is one of the most prestigious poker tournaments in the world. The event will offer a total prize pool of $8.5 million and will attract some of the top players in the world.</p>
