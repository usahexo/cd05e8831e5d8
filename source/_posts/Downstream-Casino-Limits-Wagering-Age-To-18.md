Downstream Casino Limits Wagering Age To 18

Downstream Casino will now only allow those aged 18 and older to gamble at the casino. This change will take full effect starting on September 5th, 2017.

According to Downstream’s Director of Marketing, the decision to limit gambling to those over 18 was made in order to provide a more responsible gaming environment for our guests. This new policy aligns with the company’s goal of promoting healthy and enjoyable entertainment experiences for all of its guests.

We spoke with several guests at the casino and asked their thoughts on the change. Most were in favor of the decision, stating that it makes sense to have an age limit in place in order to protect minors from possible harmful effects of gambling. Some guests also mentioned that they feel more comfortable knowing that those under 18 are not able to gamble at Downstream Casino.

Downstream Casino is not alone in implementing an age requirement for gambling – many other casinos across the country have already done so. And while this may come as a disappointment to some, we encourage our guests to explore the many other exciting entertainment options available at Downstream Resort.

#  Downstream Casino Goes Even Younger With Wagering Age Limit At 17

The Downstream Casino Resort in Quapaw, OK has set the minimum age for gambling to 17. The casino is following the lead of its parent company, the Cherokee Nation.

In a statement, officials said that the change was meant to target a younger demographic and bring in new business.

Cherokee Nation Gaming CEO Shawn Slaton said that the decision was based on market research that showed there was potential for growth in the younger market.

Downstream Casino General Manager Stan Chilton said that the casino would be working to make sure that those under 17 are not allowed on the property. He also said that staff would be educating those who are already on site about the change in policy.

The new age limit will go into effect on November 1st.

#  Casino In Missouri Limits Wagering Age To 18

In a move that is likely to upset some Missouri casino-goers, the state's gaming commission has voted to limit casino wagering to those aged 18 and older. The measure was proposed in response to concerns that minors were being exposed to gambling at an early age.

Opponents of the age limit say that it will lead to a loss of jobs and income for the state, as well as decreased tourism. They argue that it is more appropriate to educate minors about the risks associated with gambling, rather than prohibit them from participating in it altogether.

Supporters of the age limit maintain that it is necessary to protect minors from the potential negative consequences of gambling. They argue that gambling can be addictive and can lead to financial problems for young people.

The new age limit will go into effect on January 1, 2018.

#  Missouri Casino Sets Minimum Wage At $18

When Missouri legalized casinos in 2008, the law set the minimum wage at $6.50 per hour. This week, a new casino set the minimum wage at $18 per hour, more than double the statewide minimum.

Critics say the move will hurt smaller casinos and lead to job losses. But supporters argue that it's necessary to compete with bordering states that have already raised their minimum wages.

The new casino is located in Taney County, which borders both Arkansas and Kansas. The minimum wage in those states is currently $7.25 and $7.50 per hour, respectively.

"Arkansas has a higher minimum wage, so it makes it difficult for us to compete," said casino owner Gary Taylor. "We're not trying to put anyone out of business, but we do need to pay our employees a fairly livable wage."

So far, the new casino has hired 30 people at the $18-per-hour rate. Another 120 jobs are still available.

#  Casino In Missouri Rolls Out New Minimum Wage And Wager Age Policy

On Monday, the casino in Missouri announced that it will be rolling out new policies with regards to the minimum wage and age of those who are allowed to gamble. Starting in March, all employees working at the casino must be paid a minimum of $12 per hour. In addition, persons under the age of 21 will no longer be allowed to wager on games of chance.

This change in policy comes as a reaction to recent increases in the minimum wage throughout the state. Casino management has stated that they feel obligated to ensure that their employees are fairly compensated for their work, and that they want to keep gambling accessible to adults only.

The reaction from both employees and patrons of the casino has been mixed. Many workers are happy to receive a raise, but others feel that the $12 minimum wage is still not enough to live on. Meanwhile, some customers are unhappy about the new age restriction on gambling, arguing that it unfairly disadvantages younger people who are interested in trying out this type of entertainment.

So far, there has been no word on whether or not other casinos in Missouri will be following suit and implementing similar policies.
