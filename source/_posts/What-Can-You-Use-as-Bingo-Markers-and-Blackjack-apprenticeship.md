Making Bingo Markers
The first thing you need when making Bingo markers is the supplies. You will need a paper clip, a straw, a popsicle stick, and some paint.
First, bend the paper clip into a small U shape.
Next, cut the straw in half so that you have two shorter straws.
Finally, cut the popsicle stick in half so that you have two smaller sticks.
Now it's time to paint! Use any color you want for your markers. We chose red, blue, and yellow.
Once the paint is dry, use the paper clip to attach the straws to either end of the popsicle stick.
And there you have it! Your very own Bingo markers!
Blackjack Apprenticeship
In order to become a blackjack apprentice, you will need to learn some basic rules and strategies. Here are a few of the most important ones:
1. Never take insurance - it's always a bad bet.
2. Divide your bets between multiple hands - this will increase your chances of winning overall. 
3. Stay away from pairs - they rarely win big payouts. 
4. Never stand on 17 or higher - always hit if you have that total or below. 
5. Know when to fold - if the odds are not in your favor, it's better to cut your losses and walk away from the table.
