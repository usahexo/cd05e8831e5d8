#  How to get a casino license in New Hampshire

If you're looking to open a casino in New Hampshire, you'll need to obtain a license from the state. There are several steps involved in the licensing process, and the requirements vary depending on the type of casino you want to open.

In order to apply for a license, you'll first need to submit an application with the New Hampshire Gambling Commission. The commission will review your application and may ask for additional information or documentation.

Once your application is approved, you'll then need to get approval from the local municipality where you want to open the casino. This process typically includes a public hearing, during which local residents will have an opportunity to voice their concerns about the casino.

If everything goes smoothly, you'll then receive your license from the Gambling Commission and can start operations. However, keep in mind that your casino may be subject to periodic reviews by the commission and could be revoked if it fails to meet certain standards.
