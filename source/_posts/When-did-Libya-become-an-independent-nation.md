In response, the Italian government recognized Libya as an independent nation in 1951.

#  What is the size of Libya's economy?

 Libya has a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $67.5 billion and a GDP per capita of $12,600 as of 2016, according to the World Bank. The country's GDP is expected to reach $104.7 billion by 2020, at a projected growth rate of 4.3%. 

The services sector accounts for the majority of Libya's GDP, contributing around 62% of the total in 2016. The country's oil and gas resources are a key driver of its economy, with the hydrocarbons sector accounting for about 38% of GDP and 94% of exports in 2016.

Since the 2011 uprising that ousted former dictator Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan economy has been struggling. The ongoing conflict and political instability have taken their toll on economic output and foreign investment. Inflation has also been on the rise, reaching 31% in 2017. Economic growth slowed down to an estimated 2% in 2017 from 5.5% in 2016., 

Despite these challenges, Libya still holds potential for economic growth. A focus on developing non-oil sectors and improving infrastructure could help catalyze growth in the coming years.
