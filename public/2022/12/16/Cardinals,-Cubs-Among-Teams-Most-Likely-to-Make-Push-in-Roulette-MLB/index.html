        <h1 id="Cardinals-Cubs-Among-Teams-Most-Likely-to-Make-Push-in-Roulette-MLB"><a href="#Cardinals-Cubs-Among-Teams-Most-Likely-to-Make-Push-in-Roulette-MLB" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals, Cubs Among Teams Most Likely to Make Push in Roulette MLB"></a>Cardinals, Cubs Among Teams Most Likely to Make Push in Roulette MLB</h1><p>When looking at the current MLB standings, it’s clear that there is a clear separation between the best and worst teams in baseball. Just past the halfway point of the season, it looks like there are only a handful of teams that have any real chance at making it to the postseason.</p>
<p>But if you take a closer look, there are a few teams that could make a late push and potentially surprise some people. The Cardinals and Cubs are both among the most likely candidates to make a run in roulette MLB.</p>
<p>The Cardinals got off to a bit of a slow start this season, but they have been playing much better lately. They currently sit 4.5 games back of the first place Brewers in the NL Central, but with 42 games remaining, they still have plenty of time to make up ground.</p>
<p>And as we have seen in recent years, the Cardinals are always one of the most dangerous teams in the playoffs. They have plenty of experience and playoff know-how, and they always seem to find a way to get it done when it matters most.</p>
<p>The Cubs got off to a blazing hot start this season, but they have cooled off considerably recently. They currently sit 5 games back of the first place Brewers in the NL Central, but again, they still have plenty of time to make up ground.</p>
<p>The Cubs are loaded with talent, and they showed last year that they can definitely compete with anyone when they are playing their best baseball. If they can get back on track and start playing like the team we all know they can be, then there is no doubt that they can make a serious run at winning the World Series.</p>
<h1 id="Dodgers-Nationals-Expected-to-Be-in-Playoff-Picture"><a href="#Dodgers-Nationals-Expected-to-Be-in-Playoff-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers, Nationals Expected to Be in Playoff Picture"></a>Dodgers, Nationals Expected to Be in Playoff Picture</h1><p>The MLB season is right around the corner, and that means it’s time for predictions. Most experts are predicting that the Dodgers and Nationals will be in the playoff picture.</p>
<p>The Dodgers made some major acquisitions over the offseason, including superstar pitcher Clayton Kershaw and second baseman Howie Kendrick. Kershaw is coming off of an injury-plagued season, but is still one of the best pitchers in baseball. The Nationals made a few smaller moves, but are still one of the top teams in the league.</p>
<p>Other teams expected to make the playoffs include the Cardinals, Giants, and Tigers. The Cardinals are always a contender, and the Giants have won three World Series in the last six years. The Tigers lost Max Scherzer to free agency, but still have one of the most potent offenses in baseball.</p>
<p>There are a few teams that are expected to struggle this season. The Red Sox were recently rocked with news of widespread PED use in their organization, and their lineup looks much weaker without Adrian Gonzalez and Jon Lester. The Yankees are also dealing with some injuries, and their aging roster might not be able to keep up with other teams in the tough American League East division.</p>
<p>It should be a very exciting season, with plenty of talented players and exciting matchups. Who will come out on top? Only time will tell!</p>
<h1 id="Yankees-Poised-for-a-Run-at-the-Pennant"><a href="#Yankees-Poised-for-a-Run-at-the-Pennant" class="headerlink" title="Yankees Poised for a Run at the Pennant"></a>Yankees Poised for a Run at the Pennant</h1><p>For the last few years, the New York Yankees have been a team in transition. They have not been able to put together a winning season and make it to the playoffs. This year, they seem poised to change all that.</p>
<p>The Yankees have made some key acquisitions in the offseason that should help them get over the hump. They traded for Sonny Gray from the Oakland Athletics, and he should be a great addition to their starting rotation. In addition, they signed CC Sabathia and Todd Frazier to short-term deals.</p>
<p>Sabathia is coming off of a poor season, but he has had success in the past with the Yankees. Frazier is coming off of a great year with the Cincinnati Reds and should provide some power at third base. These signings show that the Yankees are serious about winning now.</p>
<p>The Yankees also have some young stars who are ready to breakout. Aaron Judge had a fantastic rookie season last year and should only get better in his second year. Gary Sanchez also had a great rookie year and looks poised to be one of the best catchers in baseball.</p>
<p>The bullpen is also looking strong for the Yankees this year. Aroldis Chapman is back after signing a five-year deal in the offseason, and Dellin Betances is still one of the most dominant relievers in baseball. The rest of the bullpen is solid as well, and it could be one of the best in baseball this year.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Yankees look like they are going to be one of the best teams in baseball this year. They have a great mix of veterans and young players, and they seem poised to make a run at the pennant.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Sox-Eyeing-Another-Chance-at-World-Series-Glory"><a href="#Red-Sox-Eyeing-Another-Chance-at-World-Series-Glory" class="headerlink" title="Red Sox Eyeing Another Chance at World Series Glory"></a>Red Sox Eyeing Another Chance at World Series Glory</h1><p>After a disappointing 2017 season, the Red Sox are looking to rebound in 2018. They have made some key offseason acquisitions, including pitcher Nathan Eovaldi and second baseman Ian Kinsler.</p>
<p>Eovaldi is coming off a solid season with the Tampa Bay Rays, during which he posted a 3.23 ERA. He will be a welcome addition to the Red Sox starting rotation, which struggled last season.</p>
<p>Kinsler is also coming off a strong season, with the Detroit Tigers. He hit .288/.412/.484 last year and should provide a big boost to the Red Sox offense.</p>
<p>With these new additions, as well as other key players like Mookie Betts and Chris Sale, the Red Sox are poised for another postseason run. They will be looking to win their fourth World Series championship in the last 15 years.</p>
<h1 id="Astros-Look-to-Defend-Their-Title"><a href="#Astros-Look-to-Defend-Their-Title" class="headerlink" title="Astros Look to Defend Their Title"></a>Astros Look to Defend Their Title</h1><p>The Houston Astros will enter the 2019 season as defending World Series champions. They will look to repeat as champions and become just the second team in history to do so.</p>
<p>The Astros have a strong lineup returning, headlined by AL MVP Jose Altuve. They also have a solid pitching staff, led by Cy Young winner Justin Verlander.</p>
<p>Houston will face stiff competition from the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees in the American League East. The Cleveland Indians and Oakland Athletics should also be competitive in the American League Central.</p>
<p>In the National League, the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers are the favorites to win their respective divisions. The Colorado Rockies are also contenders in the National League West.</p>
<p>Houston is a strong contender to make another run at the World Series this year. They are an experienced team that knows how to win championships. Look for them to be one of the top teams in baseball again in 2019.</p>
