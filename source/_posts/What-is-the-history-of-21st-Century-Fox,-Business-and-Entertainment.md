#  What is the history of 21st Century Fox, Business and Entertainment?

21st Century Fox is an American multinational mass media corporation. It was formed on July 8, 2013 as a result of the splitting of the larger News Corporation. The new company consisted of the broadcasting assets of the former News Corporation, including Fox Entertainment Group, Fox Network Group, and their regional sports networks. The 21st Century Fox name is a result of its predecessor company's history dating back to 1929.

The origins of 21st Century Fox can be traced back to 1882 when two Australian newspapers were founded: The Sydney Morning Herald and The Melbourne Age. In 1929, these newspapers were merged to form Australian Consolidated Press (ACP). ACP would go on to become one of the largest media groups in Australia.

In 1984, ACP was sold to Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation. Murdoch became Chairman and CEO of the new company, which was then renamed News Limited. In 1990, News Limited acquired John Fairfax Holdings, which would later become the parent company of Fairfax Media.

In July 2013, News Corporation split into two separate companies: 21st Century Fox and News Corp. 21st Century Fox consisted of the broadcasting assets (Fox Entertainment Group, Fox Network Group, and their regional sports networks), while News Corp consisted of the print publications and other assets (such as Dow Jones & Company).

21st Century Fox is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. They have operations in over 50 countries and employ over 25,000 people worldwide. The company's major divisions are: Cable Network Programming; Television; Filmed Entertainment; Direct Broadcast Satellite Television; Publishing;and Other Corporate Activities.

Some of 21st Century Fox's most well-known brands include FOX Broadcasting Company (FOX), FOX Sports Networks, FOX Cable Networks, 20th Century FOX Film Corporation, FX Networks, National Geographic Partners LLC., and STAR India Pvt Ltd..

#  Why did 21st Century Fox, Business and Entertainment merge?

The 21st Century Fox Business and Entertainment merger is one of the most interesting and complex deals in recent memory. So why did these two companies merge?

On the surface, it would seem that there are three potential reasons for the merger:
1) The companies are pursuing synergies between their businesses (i.e. they can save money by combining operations).
2) The companies want to pool their resources to create new content or experiences.
3) There is a strategic rationality to the deal – one company dominates in one area, and the other dominates in another, and together they can be stronger than either company on its own.

Let’s take a closer look at each of these possibilities.

1) Savings from synergies is definitely a big reason for many mergers, but usually this is something that happens after the deal goes through, not before it’s announced. In this case, it’s possible that Fox was looking to buy Entertainment because it was struggling, and so getting rid of Business made sense in order to make the overall company more attractive (and increase the sale price).
2) This seems like a plausible reason for the merger, especially given how important content is today. However, it’s worth noting that Fox has been quite successful with its own content without merging with Entertainment – so why now? It could be that Fox is sensing competition from companies like Amazon and Netflix, which are spending billions of dollars on original content. Or it could be that Disney’s proposed acquisition of Fox posed a threat to Entertainment (more on this below).
3) This is probably the strongest reason for the merger. By acquiring Entertainment, Fox gained control of valuable assets like movie studios and cable networks. And by acquiring Business, Entertainment gained a foothold in areas like broadcasting and sports rights. Taken together, these assets create a much stronger company than either company would be on its own.

So what does this mean for consumers?

There are pros and cons to any merger – in this case, it’s likely that we will see increased prices for content (especially when compared to services like Netflix), as well as fewer choices when it comes to where we can watch our favourite shows and movies. However, Fox also has a history of being customer-friendly – so hopefully we won’t see too much of a change in this area.

#  What challenges does 21st Century Fox, Business and Entertainment face in the future?

21st Century Fox is a multinational mass media company that operates in the business and entertainment industries. The company has been around for over 85 years and has faced a lot of changes throughout the years. In this article, we will be discussing some of the challenges that 21st Century Fox, Business and Entertainment face in the future.

One of the biggest challenges that 21st Century Fox faces is its film division. The division has been struggling to keep up with its competitors, such as Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. In order for 21st Century Fox to stay competitive in this market, it needs to come up with innovative ideas and make more blockbuster hits.

In terms of its entertainment division, 21st Century Fox also needs to stay ahead of the curve. With the ever-growing trend of online streaming services, such as Netflix and Hulu, 21st Century Fox needs to find a way to compete. One possible solution is by creating its own online streaming service or partnering with an existing one.

Another big challenge for 21st Century Fox is its relationship with Disney. Since Disney announced its intention to purchase most of 21st Century Fox’s assets, there have been concerns about how this will impact competition in the industry. Some believe that this will give Disney too much power and allow it to monopolize the market. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the future.
