#  GTA Online How to Enjoy Casino Mission with Friends

If you love playing the Casino Missions in GTA Online then you know that it can be a lonely experience. Even though Rockstar has added some great new features with the Gunrunning update, the Casino Missions are still a bit too solitary for many players’ liking.

But now there is a way to enjoy these missions with friends. Simply start up a game and invite them into your session. They will then have to accept the invitation in order to join your game.

Once they are in, you can all work together to complete the mission. This is especially helpful if one of your group gets stuck on a certain part of the mission. Just make sure you don’t hog all of the rewards for yourself!

Another way to enjoy the Casino Missions with friends is to set up your own mission using the creator tools. This will give you more control over the particular mission you want to play, and you can even add your own challenges and rewards.

Just make sure that everyone who wants to take part knows the password for your custom mission so they can join in easily. And once again, don’t be selfish and hog all of the rewards for yourself!
