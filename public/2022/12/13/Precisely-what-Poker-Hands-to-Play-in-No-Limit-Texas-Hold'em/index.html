The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the seven cards you are dealt (two in your hand and five on the table).</p>
<p>There are a total of 252 different ways to make a five-card hand, so players need to be aware of which hands are worth playing and which should be folded. In this article, we will take a look at the six strongest hands in no limit Texas Hold’em, as well as some tips on when to play each one.</p>
<p>A Royal Flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten, all of the same suit. This hand is very rare and should only be played when you are sure that you have the best hand.</p>
<p>An Ace-King (also called a “Pair”) is a strong hand that should be played in most situations. If you are playing against just one other player, then it can be worth betting or raising with this hand if you believe that you have the best.</p>
<p>A Ten-Nine (aka “Aces Full”) is another strong hand that should usually be played when there are just two players remaining in the pot. This hand beats both a Pair and two overcards.</p>
<p>A Queen-Jack (a “Straight”) is also a strong hand that should generally be played in most situations. It is worth noting, however, that this hand can be beaten by both a higher straight (e.g. Ten-Jack-Queen-King-As) or by three of a kind.</p>
<p>An Ace-Six (aka “High Card”) is not a particularly strong hand, but it can still be worth playing in some circumstances. For example, if there are only three players left in the pot and you have an Ace-Six but everyone else has folded, then it might be worth betting or raising because you have better odds than either of the other players remaining.</p>

By knowing which hands to play and which ones to fold, you can increase your chances of winning pots.</p>
<p>Here are the five best hands to play in a no limit game:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Aces: Aces are the best possible hand in no limit poker, and they should always be played if possible. With two aces, you have a strong chance of winning the pot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kings: King-high is a great hand in no limit poker, and it should be played whenever possible. If you hit a king on the flop, you will likely have the best hand and be able to take down the pot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Queens: queens are another strong hand in no limit poker, and they should be played whenever possible. If you hit a queen on the flop, you will likely have one of the strongest hands at the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jacks: jacks are also a strong hand in no limit poker, and they should generally be played if possible. With jacks, you have a good chance of winning the pot if you hit any other card on the flop.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tens or Better: In most cases, tens or better should be played in no limit poker games. This gives you a good chance of making a strong hand and winning the pot.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Play-the-5-Best-Poker-Hands-in-NLHE"><a href="#How-to-Play-the-5-Best-Poker-Hands-in-NLHE" class="headerlink" title="How to Play the 5 Best Poker Hands in NLHE"></a>How to Play the 5 Best Poker Hands in NLHE</h1><p>Texas Hold’em is a popular poker game that is played around the world. It is one of the most widely televised casino games due to its high level of excitement and potential for big payouts. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, it is important to understand which hands are the strongest in this variant of poker.</p>
<p>The five best hands in Texas Hold’em are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of 10, J, Q, K, and A all of the same suit. This hand is unbeatable, making it a very desirable draw for players. If you are lucky enough to be holding a royal flush when all else has failed, you can be sure to take home the pot.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Straight Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A straight flush is five consecutive cards all of the same suit. This hand is second-best to a royal flush and can be extremely lucrative when played correctly. For example, if you are holding 9♣ 8♣ 7♣ 6♣ 5♣ on a board reading 2♥ 3♦ 4♥ 5♠ 6♦, you would have a straight flush and would likely win the pot.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Four of a Kind</li>
</ol>
<p>Fourth on the list of best hands in Texas Hold’em is four of a kind. This hand is made up of four cards of the same rank with any other card being used as the fifth card (known as kicker). A four of a kind can be difficult to beat and often provides players with a large payout. For instance, if you hold 4♦ 4♥ 4♠ 10♦ 2♥ on a board reading Q♦ 3♥ J♦ K♥ A♦, you would have four of a kind and would take home half of the pot.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Full House</li>
</ol>
<p>A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand can be very powerful if there are no other high-ranking hands on the table. For example, if you hold 7♥ 7♦ 2♠ on a board reading A♠ K♥ Q♦ 10♣ 4♠, you would have a full house and would likely win any ensuing battle for the pot.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>Last but not least, we have the flush which is simply five cards all of the same suit. This hand isn’t as strong as some of the others on this list but can still be very dangerous if played correctly. For example, if you hold J♦ 9♦ 7♦ 6♦ 2♥ on a board reading 5♥ 8♥ 3♥ 10♣ A♣, you would have a flush and could potentially win the whole pot depending on what your opponents were holding.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-5-best-hands-to-play-when-playing-poker"><a href="#What-are-the-5-best-hands-to-play-when-playing-poker" class="headerlink" title="What are the 5 best hands to play when playing poker?"></a>What are the 5 best hands to play when playing poker?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer as to what the five best hands to play when playing poker are. However, there are a number of hands that are considered to be much better than others. In general, the hands that stand the best chance of winning are those that contain a high card value and one or more pairs.</p>
<p>The five best hands to play when playing poker are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A-K-Q-J-10 (AKQJT) - This hand is often referred to as “the american dream” and is one of the best possible hands in poker. It has a high card value of 21 and contains two pairs (Aces and Kings).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A-K-Q-J-9 (AKQJ9) - This hand also has a high card value of 21 and contains two pairs (Aces and Kings).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A-K-Q-J-8 (AKQJ8) - This hand has a high card value of 20 and contains two pairs (Aces and Kings).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A-K-Q-J-7 (AKQJ7) - This hand has a high card value of 19 and contains two pairs (Aces and Kings).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A-K-Q-J-6 (AKQJ6) - This hand has a high card value of 18 and contains two pairs (Aces and Kings).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Knowing-What-Hands-to-Play-at-a-Low-Limit-Tournament"><a href="#Knowing-What-Hands-to-Play-at-a-Low-Limit-Tournament" class="headerlink" title="Knowing What Hands to Play at a Low Limit Tournament"></a>Knowing What Hands to Play at a Low Limit Tournament</h1><p>In any poker tournament, theobjective is to make it to the final table and finish in the money. A cash prize is guaranteed for all players who make it to the final table, with the larger prizes reserved for those who make it to the very end. This makes playing smart and conserving your chips important throughout the tournament.</p>
<p>There are various stages in a poker tournament, and knowing what hands to play changes as the tournament progresses. In general, you’ll want to play more conservatively as the stakes get higher. At lower limits, however, there are opportunities for taking more risks since the rewards are not as great.</p>
<p>In early rounds of a poker tournament, you’ll want to mostly focus on playing pocket pairs (pairs of two specific cards) and ace-king suited. These hands offer good potential for winning without too much risk. Other playable hands include small connectors (two consecutive cards that are not of the same suit) and big connectors (two consecutive cards of the same suit).</p>
<p>As you move further along in a poker tournament, your goal should be to amass as many chips as possible while still playing cautiously. This means playing only premium hands such as aces and kings, or better. You can also start playing some medium strength hands such as queen-jack suited or ace-queen suited if you’re confident that they’ll win against your opponent’s holdings.</p>
<p>By playing smart and staying within your comfort zone at lower limit tournaments, you’ll give yourself a better chance at making it to the money and perhaps even taking home first place.</p>
