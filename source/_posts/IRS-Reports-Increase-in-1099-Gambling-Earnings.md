#  IRS Reports Increase in 1099 Gambling Earnings

According to the latest reports from the IRS, there was a significant increase in the amount of money reported as gambling earnings in 2018. This uptick is likely due to the increasing popularity of online gaming and betting, as well as the growth of state-regulated sports betting.

Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, horse races, and casino games, as well as payments received for bets or wagers. It also includes any prizes or awards you receive for your participation in a gaming contest.

The IRS requires taxpayers who report gambling income on their tax return to use special forms (1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ) that include information about their winnings and losses. You must also report any gambling income on Schedule A (Form 1040), Line 21.

The amount of gambling income you report determines if you have to file Form W-2G. This form is used to report certain gambling winnings and shows the amount of winnings subject to federal income tax. Gambling establishments generally issue Form W-2G when the winnings are over $1,200 and consist of at least 300 times the amount bet or $5,000, whichever is less.

In 2018, the IRS reported that taxpayers reported more than $16 billion in gambling earnings. This is up significantly from the $14 billion that was reported in 2017. The majority of this income ($14 billion) was from individual taxpayers, while businesses and other organizations accounted for the remaining $2 billion.

The states with the highest amounts of gambling income were California ($2.4 billion), New York ($1.7 billion), and Florida ($1.6 billion). These three states accounted for more than one-third of all gambling income reported in 2018.

It's important to note that not all gambling income is taxable. Gambling losses can be claimed as a deduction on your tax return, but they must be calculated separately from your winnings. You can only deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings for the year.

#  IRS Issues Guidelines for 1099 Gambling Earnings

On January 10, 2019, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released final guidelines for taxpayers reporting gambling income on Form 1099-G. The new guidelines provide clarity on how to report gambling winnings and losses, and include specific instructions for reporting casino, lottery, and other gambling winnings.

Under the new guidelines, taxpayers must report all of their gambling winnings on Form 1099-G, regardless of whether they are subject to federal income tax. Gambling losses may be deducted up to the amount of gambling winnings reported on the form, but only if the taxpayer itemizes deductions on their federal income tax return.

The IRS also issued guidance for taxpayers receiving Form 1099-MISC with gambling winnings reported in box 7. In most cases, these taxpayers will report their gambling income and losses on Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business. However, if the taxpayer's only business is gambling, they will report their income and losses on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions.

Taxpayers should review the new guidelines carefully to ensure that they are reporting their gambling income and losses accurately. For more information on reporting gambling income and losses, please consult a tax professional or visit the IRS website.

#  What You Need to Know About 1099 Gambling Earnings

If you've ever won or lost money gambling, you might be curious about what to do with your earnings. The good news is that gambling income is taxable, but the bad news is that there are a few specific things you need to know in order to correctly report it on your tax return. In this article, we'll go over the basics of 1099 gambling earnings so that you can be sure to handle them correctly.

First and foremost, it's important to understand that not all gambling income is considered taxable. Winnings from games of chance, like lotteries and casino games, are typically taxable, while winnings from casual betting or contests aren't. This is because the IRS considers gambling to be a form of entertainment, and thus any income generated from it is considered taxable.

In addition, losses from gambling activities can also be deducted from your taxable income. However, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings for the year. So if you won $1,000 in casino games but also lost $1,000 in the same year, you can only claim a $1,000 deduction for your losses.

If you have 1099 gambling earnings for the year, there are a couple of specific things you need to note on your tax return. First and foremost, you'll need to report the amount of your earnings as income on line 21 of your Form 1040. In addition, if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A, you'll be able to claim a deduction for your losses on line 28. This deduction can be taken whether or not you itemize any other deductions on Schedule A.

By understanding the basics of 1099 gambling earnings, you'll be able to ensure that you're reporting them correctly on your tax return. With this information in hand, you'll be able to enjoy peace of mind knowing that you're taking care of everything properly.
