#  Qatar's Sheikh Joins International Poker Tournament

Doha, Qatar - The sheikh of Qatar has joined an international poker tournament in the country's capital.

The Sheikh, who is known for his love of gambling, is competing in the Doha Classic Poker Tournament at the Hilton hotel.

So far, he has enjoyed some success in the event, winning a number of small pots.

The Sheikh is no stranger to big-name poker tournaments. In 2009, he competed in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas and finished in the money.

Some observers have said that the Sheikh's presence could give a boost to the tournament, which has so far been overshadowed by the nearby Qatar Masters golf tournament.

#  Qatar Inventors Claimed to Create the Modern Poker 

As the inventors of modern poker, Qataris can take rightful pride in their place in history. The game as it is now known is said to have originated in their country in the early 1800s, and has since been enjoyed by people from all corners of the world. Poker is a hugely popular pastime and source of income for many, and the Qataris can be thanked for that.

The story goes that a Persian trader named Nasruddin was visiting Qatar and taught the locals how to play a card game using five cards called As Nas. The game quickly grew in popularity, with different regions developing their own variations. In 1829, Lieutenant-Colonel John Allnutt of the British Army is said to have brought poker to India, where it took on its current form. From there, it made its way to America and the rest is history.

Qataris continue to enjoy playing poker to this day, and the country has seen some top players come out of its borders. Some of the most notable include Fahad Al-Thani, who won the World Poker Tour (WPT) Ladies Tournament in 2017; Mohammed Hariz, who took down two WSOP bracelets in 2013; and Khalid Shaheen, who won a European Poker Tour (EPT) event in 2016.

The legacy of poker’s creation by Qataris will continue long into the future, as more people discover and appreciate this fascinating game.
